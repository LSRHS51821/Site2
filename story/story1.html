  <p>You are born in Corona, a land where dragons rule and humans are your subjects. However, there are still a few human nobilities left, even though they do not have much power besides overseeing infrastructure. One of these remaining nobilities is ruled by King Herod, who is a cruel man. He has a daughter named Andromeda, but keeps her locked away in a tower in order to "protect" her from the dangers of society.</p>
  <p>Are you going to be a ferocious and daredevil dragon or a timid and unassuming dragon?</p>
