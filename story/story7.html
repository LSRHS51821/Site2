  <p>Flying to the castle, you circle around the city, and notice all of the people working for King Herod. They are actively not doing anything to help the princess locked away in the tower. Taking in a huge gulp of air, you let the fire escape from your throat. You burn down everything in your path surrounding the tower, including all of the guards protecting the castle. They try to fight back by shooting arrows and spears but you quickly take them down.</p>
  <p>Now there is no one left stopping you from rescuing the princess, so you fly and climb up to the window at the top of the stone tower. Princess Andromeda is there waiting, and climbs onto your back without hesitation. You fly away with her on your back and take her to safety, forever away from her evil father.</p>
