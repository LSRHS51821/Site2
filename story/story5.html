  <p>You are very angry that the neighboring clan stole the treasure from the castle so you gather together all of your dragon battle mates and fly to the neighboring clan. When you get there, you announce that you declare war on them if they do not hand over the treasure. The evil dragons refuse and so you throw yourself in to an all out war.</p>
  <p>The leader of the other clan picks you out amongst the battling dragons and fire, deciding he wants to battle you head on. He is probably the strongest dragon in all of the land so you need to make a crucial decision:</p>
  <p>Will you take his challenge and battle or contain your ferocity and let your friend handle the leader?</p>
