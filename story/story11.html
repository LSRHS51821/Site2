  <p>You decide wisely to stay back and fight the more manageable dragons. However, you do win every battle between each dragon that comes up to you, so eventually they stop trying to fight you because they know that they will die. Those dragons chicken out and leave until it is only the leader of the enemy clan left, and seeing that he had no one to back him up, surrendered.</p>
  <p>You win the battle, and, having a last minute epiphany, realize that you still have time to save the princess before your rival can. You realize that she still needs your help to not fall into the wrong hands.</p>
  <p>Rushing back to the tower at the castle, you beat your rival dragon there. You rescue Andromeda and fly her away to safety, setting her free so she can never be harmed again.</p>
