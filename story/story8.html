  <p>You travel to the city, where there are guards waiting to stop you. They are surrounding the base of the tower and are perched on small towers surrounding the big one. The tower is so tall that you realize you cannot possibly fly up to the top, so you have to climb it. The guards shoot their arrows and swords at you, some actually penetrating your skin.</p>
  <p>However, they are no match for your power and strength, since you are one of the strongest dragons in Corona. You take down the guards with relative ease, scaling the tower as you go, your claws holding your grip. You reach the top of the tower, where Princess Andromeda awaits you. She climbs onto your back and you jump, soaring down over the fallen guards and away forever.</p>
