  <p>You engage in the battle with the other leader, however you soon realize that he is overpowering you. He is much stronger than you and no matter how ahrd you try, you cannot get him to fall. You bang into him as hard as you can and breathe fire as much as possible, but he resists and hits you back with twice the amount of force.</p>
  <p>The other dragon gives the final blow to your body, and you fall and die, leaving the rest of your army to fend for themselves. The enemy clan wins the battle and proceed to the castle where they take Andromeda from the tower and keep her hostage for eternity.</p>
