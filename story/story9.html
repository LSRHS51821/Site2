  <p>You fly to the gate of the castle, where you explain to the guards that you wish to speak with the king privately. With a confused expression on the guards face, they reluctently take you up to the king's chamber. You demand to the king that he let his daugther, Princess Andromeda, go free. He stares at you, then laughs in your face, signaling to the guards to take you into custody.</p>
  <p>The guards are on you before you can even move, they chain you up and take you down into their dungeons for eternity while the princess remains in her tower forever as well.</p>
